The OneClick Chrome extension is a new product out of BitTorrent’s Torque Labs that allows you to download BitTorrent files right from within your Google Chrome browser. With OneClick Chrome extension you download the contents of a BitTorrent the same way you would any other file, but without using a standalone BitTorrent client like uTorrent.
“OneClick offers a browser torrent downloading experience that mimics normal downloads,” say the extension’s developers. “No need for a torrent client to manage your downloads, just download, open and enjoy.”
OneClick is just part of what BitTorrent Inc. hopes will be a whole new era of third-party developers utilizing the power of the BitTorrent protocol to share or stream content with family, friends, and others.
“BitTorrent Torque is a JavaScript interface to a custom torrent client that exposes all the power of BitTorrent to web developers,” writes BitTorrent Inc. in a blog post announcing the new effort. “Simply put, it allows anyone to utilize our powerful technology to create completely fresh and new experiences for users with just a couple lines of code.
Chrome: BitTorrent clients aren't hard to come by, but if you don't want to deal with extra software, OneClick is a Chrome extension that downloads torrents directly in your browser.
With OneClick installed you simply have to click on a torrent file and it will start downloading the torrent contents directly with Chrome. I had mixed luck with getting OneClick to work. The extension's main page suggests you try a Counting Crows official torrent and that worked fine, but OneClick didn't recognize a few different Linux torrents. If you le OneClick sit for a while it will usually eventually trigger the download. OneClick doesn't offer the features of a dedicated BitTorrent client, but it might come in handy for the occasional download.
Downloading a torrent file just got more easier. Now instead of using a software or a BitTorrent client such as uTorrent you can just download a small Google Chrome extension from the bit torrent labs site and you’re good to go.

This will help you download torrent files easily on your own computer and also help you more on a new computer where you won’t have much hassle to download the bit torrent client first and then download torrents.

This Google Chrome extension called as OneClick, is developed by the BitTorrent’s Torque Labs,  It’s super handy and skips mostly all the steps done in downloading a torrent file.
